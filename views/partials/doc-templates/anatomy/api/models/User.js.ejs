<p>This file was created when you ran &apos;sails generate api User&apos;.  It contains the structure for the model called &apos;User&apos;.</p>
<p>In this file you will specify what attributes each model instance (record) should have.  You can also add custom model instance methods, as well as override the global settings for things like <code>policies</code> and <code>connections</code>.</p>
<p>One of the best parts about Sails is it uses <a href="https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline" target="_blank">Waterline</a>.  This means you can start developing your data models long before you commit to a particular database.</p>
