<h3 id="purpose" permalink="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This is an example policy file against which all routes are checked before allowing a client access to any part of your app.  By default, it allows everyone to access everything but this can (and probably should) be changed before you switch into production mode.</p>
<p>In Sails, a policy is simply express middleware that does something to authenticate users before they are allowed to access some part of your app.  For more information on creating policies, you&apos;ll probably want to check our guide on it.</p>
