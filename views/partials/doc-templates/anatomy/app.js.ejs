<p>This file is the conventional entry point for a <em>production</em> Sails/Node.js app.</p>
<p>When developing on your local computer, and you run <code>sails lift</code>, the code in <code>app.js</code> is not executed.  Instead, this file exists to provide an easy, out-of-the-box way to run your app <em>without</em> typing <code>sails lift</code>.  This is most likely how you&apos;ll start your app in production (i.e. <code>node app</code>, or <code>npm start</code>).</p>
<p>For example, when you deploy to most PaaS vendors like <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, they will automatically detect that you&apos;re running a Sails/Node.js app and execute this file with the <code>NODE_ENV</code> environment variable set to production.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever stage of the development lifecycle you&apos;re at, you can safely ignore <code>app.js</code>.  It&apos;s good to go out of the box for most apps.  But the code in <code>app.js</code> also serves as an easy-to-reference example of how to use Sails programmatically.  So you might want to take a look at it if you plan on writing automated tests, scheduled jobs, manual database migrations, or administration scripts.</p>
