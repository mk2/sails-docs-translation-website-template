<p>This is a configuration file that allows you to customize the way your app talks to clients over Socket.IO.</p>
<p>It provides transparent access to Sails&apos; encapsulated pubsub/socket server for complete customizability. In it you can do things on the list below (and more!).</p>
<ul>
<li>Override afterDisconnect function (server side)</li>
<li>Define custom authorization logic for client socket connections</li>
<li>Set transport method</li>
<li>Change Heartbeat Interval</li>
<li>Change socket store</li>
</ul>

  *                                                                          *
  * Node.js (and consequently Sails.js) apps scale horizontally. It&apos;s a      *
  * powerful, efficient approach, but it involves a tiny bit of planning. At *
  * scale, you&apos;ll want to be able to copy your app onto multiple Sails.js    *
  * servers and throw them behind a load balancer.                           *
  *                                                                          *
  * One of the big challenges of scaling an application is that these sorts  *
  * of clustered deployments cannot share memory, since they are on          *
  * physically different machines. On top of that, there is no guarantee     *
  * that a user will &quot;stick&quot; with the same server between requests (whether  *
  * HTTP or sockets), since the load balancer will route each request to the *
  * Sails server with the most available resources. However that means that  *
  * all room/pubsub/socket processing and shared memory has to be offloaded  *
  * to a shared, remote messaging queue (usually Redis)                      *
  *                                                                          *
  * Luckily, Socket.io (and consequently Sails.js) apps support Redis for    *
  * sockets by default. To enable a remote redis pubsub server, uncomment    *
  * the config below.                                                        *
  *                                                                          *
  * Worth mentioning is that, if `adapter` config is `redis`, but host/port  *
  * is left unset, Sails will try to connect to redis running on localhost   *
  * via port 6379                                                            *
  *                                                                          *

  * a cookie (this is used by the sails.io.js socket client to get access to *

  * Warning: Currently in this scenario, CORS settings apply to interpreted  *

  * This custom beforeConnect function will be run each time BEFORE a new    *
  * socket is allowed to connect, when the initial socket.io handshake is    *
  * performed with the server.                                               *
  *                                                                          *
  * By default, when a socket tries to connect, Sails allows it, every time. *
  * (much in the same way any HTTP request is allowed to reach your routes.  *
  * If no valid cookie was sent, a temporary session will be created for the *
  * connecting socket.                                                       *
  *                                                                          *
  * If the cookie sent as part of the connetion request doesn&apos;t match any    *
  * known user session, a new user session is created for it.                *
  *                                                                          *
  * In most cases, the user would already have a cookie since they loaded    *
  * the socket.io client and the initial HTML pageyou&apos;re building.           *
  *                                                                          *
  * However, in the case of cross-domain requests, it is possible to receive *
  * a connection upgrade request WITHOUT A COOKIE (for certain transports)   *
  * In this case, there is no way to keep track of the requesting user       *
  * between requests, since there is no identifying information to link      *
  * him/her with a session. The sails.io.js client solves this by connecting *
  * to a CORS/jsonp endpoint first to get a 3rd party cookie(fortunately this*
  * works, even in Safari), then opening the connection.                     *
  *                                                                          *
  * You can also pass along a ?cookie query parameter to the upgrade url,    *
  * which Sails will use in the absense of a proper cookie e.g. (when        *
  * connecting from the client):                                             *
  * io.sails.connect(&apos;http://localhost:1337?cookie=smokeybear&apos;)              *
  *                                                                          *
  * Finally note that the user&apos;s cookie is NOT (and will never be) accessible*
  * from client-side javascript. Using HTTP-only cookies is crucial for your *
  * app&apos;s security.                                                          *
  *                                                                          *
