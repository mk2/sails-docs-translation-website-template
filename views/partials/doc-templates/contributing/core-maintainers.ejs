<h1 id="core-maintainers">Core Maintainers</h1>
<p>The Sails.js core maintainers are a small team of individuals located in Austin, TX who are passionate about making it easier for everyone to develop scalable, secure, custom web applications.  We fell in love with Node.js at first sight and are firm believers in the continued, unprecedented dominance of JavaScript as a unifying force for good.  We see Node.js as the logical continuation of the web standards movement into the world of server-side development.</p>
<p>The Sails core team maintains the framework and its related sub-projects, including the Waterline ORM, the Node-Machine project, the Skipper body parser, and all officially-supported generators, adapters, and hooks.  We rely heavily on the help of a network of contributors and users all over the world, but make all final decisions about our releases and roadmap.</p>
