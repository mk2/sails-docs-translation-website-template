<h1 id="proposing-features-and-enhancements">Proposing Features and Enhancements</h1>
<p>Sails contributors have learned over the years that keeping track of feature requests in the same bucket as potentially-critical issues leads to a dizzying number of open issues on GitHub, and makes it harder for the community as a whole to respond to bug reports.  It also introduces a categorization burden: Imagine a GitHub issue that is 2 parts feature request, 3 parts question, but also has a <em>teensie pinch</em> of immediately-relevant-and-critical-issue-with-the-latest-stable-version-of-Sails-that-needs-immediate-attention.</p>
<p>If suggestions, requests, or pleas for features or enhancements are submitted as GitHub issues, they will be closed by <a href="http://asksailsbot.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">sailsbot</a> or one of her lackeys in the Sails core team.  This doesn&apos;t mean the core team does not appreciate your willingness to share your experience and ideas with us; we just ask that you use our new process.  Instead of creating a GitHub issue, please submit your proposal for a new feature or an extension to an existing feature using the process outlined under <a href="/docs/contributing/proposing-features-enhancements/submitting-a-proposal">Submitting a Proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Please <strong>do not propose <em>changes to the established conventions or default settings</em> of Sails</strong>. These types of discussions tend to start &quot;religious wars&quot; about topics like EJS vs. Jade, Grunt vs. Gulp, Express vs. Hapi, etc., and managing those arguments creates rifts and consumes an inordinate amount of contributors&apos; time.  Instead, if you have concerns about the opinions, conventions or default configuration in Sails, please <a href="mailto:inquiries@sailsjs.com">contact the core maintainers directly</a>.</p>
