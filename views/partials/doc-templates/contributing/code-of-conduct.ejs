<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The Code of Conduct explains the <em>bare minimum</em> behavior expectations the Sails project requires of its contributors.  This Code of Conduct is adapted from the version used by the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_blank">Node.js core team</a>.  Their version was originally borrowed from <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html" target="_blank">Rust lang&apos;s excellent CoC</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.</li>
<li>Please avoid using overtly sexual, racial, or political nicknames, or any other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.</li>
<li>Please be kind and courteous. There&apos;s no need to be mean or rude.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of personal pronouns in any code comments or documentation where such use could be perceived in a negative light. There is no need to address persons when explaining code (e.g. &quot;When the developer&quot;).</li>
<li>Respect that some individuals and cultures consider the casual use of profanity offensive and off-putting.</li>
<li>Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.</li>
<li>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</li>
<li>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term
&quot;harassment&quot; as including the definition in the <a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/" target="_blank">Citizen Code of
Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of
clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
their definition, or ask one of the project maintainers first.
In particular, we don&apos;t tolerate defamatory remarks or behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups, or for whom English
is not a native language.</li>
<li>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if
you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
by a community member, please contact one of the core maintainers immediately
via private message on Twitter or by emailing <a href="inquiries@sailsjs.com">inquiries@sailsjs.com</a>.
In either case, include a capture (screenshot, log, photo, email) of
the harassment if possible. Whether you&apos;re a regular contributor or
a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe, comfortable
place for you and we&apos;ve got your back.</li>
<li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome,
and will result in your exclusion.</li>
