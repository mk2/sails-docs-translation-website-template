<h1 id="blueprint-routes">Blueprint Routes</h1>
<p>When you run <code>sails lift</code> with blueprints enabled, the framework inspects your controllers, models, and configuration in order to <a href="/documentation/concepts/Routes">bind certain routes</a> automatically. These implicit blueprint routes (sometimes called &quot;shadow routes&quot;, or even just &quot;shadows&quot;) allow your app to respond to certain requests without you having to bind those routes manually in your <code>config/routes.js</code> file.  By default, the blueprint routes point to their corresponding blueprint <em>actions</em> (see &quot;Blueprint Actions&quot; below), any of which can be overridden with custom code.</p>
<p>There are three types of blueprint routes in Sails:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RESTful routes</strong>, where the path is always <code>/:modelIdentity</code> or <code>/:modelIdentity/:id</code>.  These routes use the HTTP &quot;verb&quot; to determine the action to take; for example a <code>POST</code> request to <code>/user</code> will create a new user, and a <code>DELETE</code> request to <code>/user/123</code> will delete the user whose primary key is 123.  In a production environment, RESTful routes should generally be protected by <a href="/documentation/concepts/Policies">policies</a> to avoid unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>Shortcut routes</strong>, where the action to take is encoded in the path.  For example, the <code>/user/create?name=joe</code> shortcut creates a new user, while <code>/user/update/1?name=mike</code> updates user #1. These routes only respond to <code>GET</code> requests.  Shortcut routes are very handy for development, but generally should be disabled in a production environment.</li>
<li><strong>Action routes</strong>, which automatically create routes for your custom controller actions.  For example, if you have a <code>FooController.js</code> file with a <code>bar</code> method, then a <code>/foo/bar</code> route will automatically be created for you as long as blueprint action routes are enabled.  Unlike RESTful and shortcut routes, action routes do <em>not</em> require that a controller has a corresponding model file.</li>
</ul>
