<h3 id="overview" permalink="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Sails apps are capable of full-duplex realtime communication between the client and server.  This means that a client (e.g. browser tab, Raspberry Pi, etc) can maintain a persistent connection to a Sails backend, and messages can be sent from client to server (e.g. AJAX) or from server to client (e.g. &quot;comet&quot;) at any time.  Two common uses of realtime communication are live chat implementations and multiplayer games.  Sails implements realtime on the server using the <a href="http://socket.io" target="_blank">socket.io</a> library, and on the client using the <a href="/documentation/reference/web-sockets/socket-client/io-socket-on">sails.io.js</a> library.  Throughout the Sails documentation, the terms <strong>socket</strong> and <strong>websocket</strong> are commonly used to refer to a two-way, persistent communication channel between a Sails app and a client.</p>
<p>Communicating with a Sails app via sockets is similar to using AJAX, in that both methods allow a web page to interact with the server without refreshing.  However, sockets differ from AJAX in two important ways: first, a socket can stay connected to the server for as long as the web page is open, allowing it to maintain <em>state</em> (AJAX requests, like all HTTP requests, are <em>stateless</em>).  Second, because of the always-on nature of the connection, a Sails app can send data down to a socket at any time (hence the &quot;realtime&quot; moniker), whereas AJAX only allows the server to respond when a request is made.</p>

<p>Sockets making requests to Sails&apos; <a href="/documentation/reference/blueprint-api">blueprint actions</a> are automatically subscribed to realtime messages about the models they retrieve via the <a href="/documentation/reference/web-sockets/resourceful-pub-sub">resourceful pub-sub API</a>.  You can also use this API in your custom controller actions to send out messages to clients interested in certain models.</p>
<h5 id="example" permalink="example">Example</h5>
<p>Connect a client-side socket to the server, subscribe to the <code>user</code> event, and request <code>/user</code> to subscribe to current and future User model instances.</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;!-- Simply include the sails.io.js script, and a client socket will be created for you --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/dependencies/sails.io.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
// The automatically-created socket is exposed as io.socket.
// Use .on() to subscribe to the &apos;user&apos; event on the client.
// This event is sent by the Sails &quot;create&quot;, &quot;update&quot;,
// &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;add&quot; and &quot;remove&quot; blueprints to any socket that
// is subscribed to one or more User model instances.
io.socket.on(&apos;user&apos;, function gotHelloMessage (data) {
  console.log(&apos;User alert!&apos;, data);
});
// Using .get(&apos;/user&apos;) will retrieve a list of current User models,
// subscribe this socket to those models, AND subscribe this socket
// to notifications about new User models when they are created.
io.socket.get(&apos;/user&apos;, function gotResponse(body, response) {
  console.log(&apos;Current users: &apos;, body);
})
&lt;/script&gt;

<h3 id="custom-realtime-communication-with-sails-sockets-" permalink="custom-realtime-communication-with-sailssockets">Custom realtime communication with <code>sails.sockets</code></h3>
<p>Sails exposes a rich API on both the client and the server for sending custom realtime messages.</p>
<h5 id="example" permalink="example">Example</h5>
<p>Here&apos;s the client-side code to connect a socket to the Sails/Node.js server and listen for an socket event named &quot;hello&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;!-- Simply include the sails.io.js script, and a client socket will be created and auto-connected for you --&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/dependencies/sails.io.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;

// The auto-connecting socket is exposed as `io.socket`.

// Use `io.socket.on()` to listen for the &apos;hello&apos; event:
io.socket.on(&apos;hello&apos;, function (data) {
  console.log(&apos;Socket `&apos; + data.id + &apos;` joined the party!&apos;);
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre><!-- __LANG=%%__ -->
<p>Then, also on the client, we can send a <em>socket request</em>.  In this case, we&apos;ll wire up the browser to send a socket request when a particular button is clicked:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">$(&apos;button#say-hello&apos;).click(function (){

  // And use `io.socket.get()` to send a request to the server:
  io.socket.get(&apos;/say/hello&apos;, function gotResponse(data, jwRes) {
    console.log(&apos;Server responded with status code &apos; + jwRes.statusCode + &apos; and data: &apos;, data);
  });

});
</code></pre><!-- __LANG=%%__ -->
<p>Meanwhile, on the server...</p>
<p>To respond to requests to <code>GET /say/hello</code>, we use an action.  In our action, we&apos;ll subscribe the requesting socket to the &quot;funSockets&quot; room, then broadcast a &quot;hello&quot; message to all sockets in that room (excluding the new one).</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">// In /api/controllers/SayController.js
module.exports = {

  hello: function(req, res) {

    // Make sure this is a socket request (not traditional HTTP)
    if (!req.isSocket) {
      return res.badRequest();
    }

    // Have the socket which made the request join the &quot;funSockets&quot; room.
    sails.sockets.join(req, &apos;funSockets&apos;);

    // Broadcast a notification to all the sockets who have joined
    // the &quot;funSockets&quot; room, excluding our newly added socket:
    sails.sockets.broadcast(&apos;funSockets&apos;, &apos;hello&apos;, { howdy: &apos;hi there!&apos;}, req);

    // ^^^
    // At this point, we&apos;ve blasted out a socket message to all sockets who have
    // joined the &quot;funSockets&quot; room.  But that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean they
    // are _listening_.  In other words, to actually handle the socket message,
    // connected sockets need to be listening for this particular event (in this
    // case, we broadcasted our message with an event name of &quot;hello&quot;).  The
    // client-side you&apos;d need to write looks like this:
    // 
    // io.socket.on(&apos;hello&apos;, function (broadcastedData){
    //   console.log(data.howdy);
    //   // =&gt; &apos;hi there!&apos;
    // }
    // 

    // Now that we&apos;ve broadcasted our socket message, we still have to continue on
    // with any other logic we need to take care of in our action, and then send a
    // response.  In this case, we&apos;re just about wrapped up, so we&apos;ll continue on

    // Respond to the request with a 200 OK.
    // The data returned here is what we received back on the client as `data` in:
    // `io.socket.get(&apos;/say/hello&apos;, function gotResponse(data, jwRes) { /* ... */ });`
    return res.json({
      anyData: &apos;we want to send back&apos;
    });

  }
}
